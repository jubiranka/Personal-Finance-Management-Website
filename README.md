- **Common Components**: Shared elements (like headers, footers, and navigation bars) are written separately and included where needed to reduce redundancy.
- **Database Queries**: All MySQL queries are managed within the PHP code for database interactions.
- **Integration**: Pages are connected via `index.php` for seamless navigation and data flow.
